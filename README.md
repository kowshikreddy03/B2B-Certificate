## 🧠 About the Project

**Hoist Crate** is an **automated lifting mechanism** designed to enhance **ironing safety**. It uses a **touch sensor and servo motors** to lift the iron box automatically when not in use, preventing surface burns, overheating, and potential fire hazards. This smart system targets households, laundries, hotels, and textile industries.

> **Smart. Safe. Seamless.**  
> A step towards smarter, safer, and hassle-free ironing.
